## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/antzm/code-test/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/antzm/code-test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# How to make a simple web page on GitHub

* A web page with text and images
* Fully customizable
* Easy to create and easy to update
* No coding exprerience required
* The only language you will need is called Markown

## Creating your page:
1. Create a GitHub account at www.github.io
2. Let's assume you username on GitHub is: `user-name`
3. So, from now on, wherever it is mentioned `user-name,` you will just replace it your own GitHub username.
4. Create a new repository with this name (exactly this name): `user-name.github.io`
5. Give a description to your repository, choose to be public and choose to create a README file. Leave other options as they are.
6. As soon as your new repository is created, go to the top of the page, and click `settings`
7. Under `GitHub Pages`, select `Master Branch`
8. If you want, under 'Theme Choser', select a theme
9. Now, you've done everything and your web page is being prepared
10. After 10 minutes, your page will be published at `https://user-name.github.io`

## Updating your content:

Visiting your new web page, the only thing you will see is the name of your repository and the description you wrote. To include more content in your web page, you can edit the `README.md` file in your repository using a language called `Markdown`
